networks:
  ipv4:
    - 10.128.0.0/18
  ipv6:
    - 2a06:4b00:1000::/56
    - fd42:100c:7121::/48

# Remarks:
# fd42:100c:7121::/56 is translated to 2a06:4b00:1000::/56 via the experimental NPTv6 (RFC 6296).
# We do NOT announce 2a06:4b00:1000::/56 via ICVPN.
# Neither do we encourage the use of fd42:100c:7121::/48 to reach our community's networks.
# We opted for the described behaviour because of the following reasons:
#  - We do not know how prevalently implementations of IPv6 source address selection are in accordance with RFC 6724.
#  - Sending more RAs means more noise.
#  - Freifunk should be a part of the Internet and not our secret Darknet.
#  - Routing Internet traffic through VPNs on top of it often comes with many quirks.
#  - We still want interconnection with communites who do not have global unicast addresses in place.
#    But we encourage them to opt for global IPv6 connectivity in the long run.
# We may change this behaviour at any time. Do not rely on fd42:100c:7121::/48!
